Message from
the Mayor
Dear Residents,
On behalf of the City of Ottawa, I am pleased to introduce
the new Spring-Summer 2010 Recreation Guide.
As warmer weather approaches, we anxiously look forward to enjoying a
variety of indoor and outdoor recreational and cultural activities .

The City of Ottawa offers seasonal activities for residents of all ages and
ability, including organized soccer, softball, beach volleyball as well as biking
or walking in our many parks, and swimming at our pools and beaches .
                                                  Sincerely,
When you browse through the guide you will ﬁnd a wide selection of day
camps and programs in your neighbourhood that allow our children and youth
to stay active and engaged throughout the summer months . I encourage you
to also go online at ottawa.ca for additional recreation information including
a complete list of day camps and swimming schedules .
                                                  Larry O’Brien, Mayor,
                                                  City of Ottawa
Enjoy a healthy and active lifestyle this spring and summer in your city!

Children’s Fitness Tax Credit
Many City of Ottawa Parks, Recreation

who is under 16 years of age at the
beginning of the year in which the
expenses are paid .
If a child qualiﬁes for the disability
tax credit, parents can claim up
to $500 per year in eligible ﬁtness
expenses paid for the child who
is under 18 years of age at the
beginning of the year . Also, if at
least $100 in eligible ﬁtness expenses
has been paid for the child, an
additional amount of $500 can
be added to the eligible ﬁtness
expenses actually incurred .
Fees paid by parents must relate to
the cost of a facility membership or
registration in an eligible physical
activity program . Your receipt will
indicate whether the program that
your child is registered in is eligible
(see receipt wording).
For more information on this credit,
please see the Canada Revenue
Agency website www.cra.gc.ca/
